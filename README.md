# Michael Weiss Portfolio Page

## Description

This project is a portfolio page for myself to showcase the projects that I will be building throughout the bootcamp to potential employers. 
The motivation behind this project was to create a skeleton that I can use for my future finalized portfolio page, and to try and learn much more about structuring with Flexbox.
I learned a lot about more advanced levels of CSS, but still do not fully get Flexbox -- especially when trying to make the page transition to mobile viewports well.
